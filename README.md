# Nyce OAuth2 Connector

This extends [The PHP League's OAuth 2 Client PHP library](https://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com).  The intention of this one is to build it as an extension that fits into Laravel.

I may add to the documentation here later, because the one on the League's website is a bit vague, to say the least.
